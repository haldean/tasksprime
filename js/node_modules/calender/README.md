# CalEnder
A basic, themeable calendar datepicker for [Ender](http://ender.no.de)

![calender](http://dustindiaz.com/basement/img/calender.png)

Currently, this depends on Enders minimal starter pack [The Jeesh](https://github.com/ender-js/jeesh)

Use it like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="calender.css">
<script src="http://ender-js.s3.amazonaws.com/jeesh.min.js"></script>
<script src="calender.js"></script>
<script>
  $('input.my-date').calender()
</script>
```

If you're already using ender, you can add it to your existing instance

    $ ender add calender

# Features
There's currently no features other than it being a datepicker. More will come. Thanks.

Enjoy!
