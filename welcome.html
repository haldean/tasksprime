    <h1>tasks': Google Tasks made beautiful</h1>
    <div id="left">
      <p>Sometimes you just want to see your tasks all at once, with no
      distractions.  That's what <b>tasks'</b> does for you: all your Google
      Tasks in one place, with a simple, beautiful interface.</p>
      <a id="startnow" href="index.html#force-auth">Start using tasks' now.</a>

      <p class="fineprint"><em>Mildly important fine print:</em> we never store
      any personal information on our servers; all information is retrieved and
      stored client-side using the Google Tasks Javascript API. tasks' is not
      responsible for any loss of data caused by the use of tasks', although we
      promise to be very careful.  A popup will appear the first time you use
      tasks' to authenticate with Google; tasks' will never show any popups
      other than that. tasks' will never make changes to your task lists without
      user input.  tasks' was made by <a href="http://haldean.org">Will Haldean
        Brown</a>.
